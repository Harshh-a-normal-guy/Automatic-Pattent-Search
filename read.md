can't open links in a new tab because generate different code
current approach not working due to the fact that we are issuing request for captcha 2 times. one for get the data second for make it a doc file



remove online services due to the fact that we need to generate request to links 2 tiems. 
we need code at our code base.

train the ocr on this captcha
generate 200 or more captchas and maybe 2000 captchas  from the site.
one time me 20 captchas . . 2-3 times a day.
then use apni machine learning to train the model and then check.

currently out system is working on generating captcha.
next - put the values in form and check that next stage is coming or not using the form
use request .post
